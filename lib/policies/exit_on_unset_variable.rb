Use set -u
===========

    How often have you written a script that broke because a variable
    wasn't set? I know I have, many times.

chroot=$1
...
rm -rf $chroot/usr/share/doc 

    If you ran the script above and accidentally forgot to give a
    parameter, you would have just deleted all of your system
    documentation rather than making a smaller chroot. So what can you
    do about it? Fortunately bash provides you with set -u, which will
    exit your script if you try to use an uninitialised variable. You
    can also use the slightly more readable set -o nounset.

% bash /tmp/shrink-chroot.sh
$chroot=
david% bash -u /tmp/shrink-chroot.sh
/tmp/shrink-chroot.sh: line 3: $1: unbound variable
