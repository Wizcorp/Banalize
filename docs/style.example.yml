    Github code browser screen width
    =================================

    Max line width: 105 chars.

    Github pull request and online code viewer is about 108 characters
    wide.  To be able to browse  code on github without need to scroll
    left-right,  limit line  length to  105 characters,  to accomodate
    some extra characters Git adds for diffs (`+ `).
